# HTML/CSS/JavaScript Boilerplate
Starting template for any front-end project

## Technologies Used

+ HTML was used to build the structure and framework of the page.  The order, organization, and type of all the elements were all assigned using HTML.
+ CSS was used to style the elements on the page.  Colors, backgrounds, and positioning was all done with CSS.
+ Javascript was used to build interactivity in the page.  Any dynamic element was created using JavaScript as well as any response the page had to actions by the user.
+ My biggest achievement on this page was building a solid and reusable template for my future front-end projects.
+ The hardest part of this project was setting up the links to the external css/js in an organized manner.
